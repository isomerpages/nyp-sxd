Our focus areas include conducting research, providing education and training programmes, and collaborating on projects to enhance service experiences. By creating a platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration, we contribute to the development of Service Design and its application in real-world contexts.

Through this collective effort, we strive to create human-centered design experiences that drive positive impact. By fostering collaboration and leveraging the expertise of various stakeholders, we aim to establish the SXD Co-Lab as a leading center for innovation and a catalyst for transforming service experiences.

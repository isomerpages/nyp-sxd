**Challenge:**
To enhance staff’s journey in the phygital environment and provide a better workplace experience.

**Process:** 
IMDA’s HR, Operations, Workplace, and Digital Transformation departments came together to explore ways to enhance staff’s journey and workplace experience. The focus areas of this collaboration include staff induction, workplace environment, and digital transformation. As a key objective is to provide new employees with a comprehensive onboarding process, the team aims to ensure that every staff receives the necessary support, information, and resources to succeed in their roles. 

**Outcomes:**
By combining high-tech and high-touch elements, the solution ensures a comprehensive and engaging experience for new staff. The use of technology enhances accessibility and flexibility, while the newly created buddy programme fosters a sense of belonging and support among colleagues. This approach not only integrates new employees into the organisational culture quickly, it also equips them with the necessary knowledge to operate effectively within their respective teams.

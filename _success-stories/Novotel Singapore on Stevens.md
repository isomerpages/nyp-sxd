**Challenge:** To overcome manpower shortage in the post pandemic era. 

**Process:** With Singapore opening up to tourism once again, the industry is grappling with the shortage of manpower. This realization has sparked a collective effort among staff from different departments to envision and implement novel strategies aimed at providing an enhanced experience for both guests and staff members. By leveraging their diverse expertise and perspectives, this cross-functional team is poised to revolutionize traditional practices and create innovative solutions. Their collaborative approach ensures that all aspects of the guest experience are considered, from the moment of check-in to dining experiences and housekeeping services. The goal is to reimagine these touchpoints in a way that maximizes efficiency, optimizes resources, and prioritizes the well-being and satisfaction of guests and staff alike. 

**Outcomes:** In response to the challenges faced by the hotel industry in the wake of the pandemic, a group of 10 innovation leads together from various departments came together with NYP design students to redefine the check-in, dine-in, and housekeeping experiences.
